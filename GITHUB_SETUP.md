# GitHub Setup Instructions

To push this repository to GitHub under your account (rpretzer):

1. Create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Repository name: `usenet-newsreader` (or any name you prefer)
   - Make it public or private as you wish
   - Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

2. Push your code to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/rpretzer/usenet-newsreader.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

   (Replace `usenet-newsreader` with your actual repository name if different)

3. If you need to authenticate, GitHub may require a personal access token instead of a password.

That's it! Your code will be on GitHub.
